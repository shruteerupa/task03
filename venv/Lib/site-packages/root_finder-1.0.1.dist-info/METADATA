# root_finder
This will attempt to find the root dir of your repo starting with
the absolute path of the dir you are currently in
To still allow you to name subdirs the same as the repo the script
will return the directory once it has found the named dir and is
within a dir not equal to the parameter
The script will continue to loop until this criteria is met, or
until it reaches root - where it will raise a FileNotFoundError

    :param repo:    The name of your repository
    :param here:    The path you are currently in, or relative to
                    entered path
    :return:        The full path of your repo within your system
